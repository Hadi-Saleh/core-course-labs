## Kubernetes Resource Statuses

Below is the output from the `kubectl get` command showing the current status of pods, stateful sets, services, and persistent volume claims in a Kubernetes environment.

```bash
kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/python-app-helm-0             1/1     Running   0          3m10s
pod/python-app-helm-1             1/1     Running   0          2m48s

persistentvolumeclaim/counter-python-python-app-helm-0  Bound    pvc-3a2576de-24f1-4e5c-9b37-45a4c7e8f3b1   10Mi       RWO            standard       16m
persistentvolumeclaim/counter-python-python-app-helm-1  Bound    pvc-7de329b2-68f4-4a90-bf76-2d67a8e5f4c3   10Mi       RWO            standard       15m
```

## Volume Data

The contents of the volumes are unique to each pod, ensuring data remains intact even when pods are updated:

```bash
kubectl exec python-app-helm-0 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 29}
kubectl exec python-app-helm-1 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 13}
```

## Ordering Guarantees

Ordering is not essential in this setup as there are no dependencies between pods of the same type. An ordering requirement would be relevant if, for instance, one pod was designated for reading data and another for writing.

## Implementation of Parallel Operations

Parallel operations in this context are managed using the `podManagementPolicy` feature.

## Update Strategies

1. **Rolling Update Strategy**: Updates pods one by one. Each pod is stopped, deleted, replaced with an updated version, and then started. This approach minimizes downtime and reduces performance impact when multiple replicas are present.
2. **Recreate Strategy**: Updates all pods simultaneously. This involves stopping and deleting all existing pods, followed by the creation and startup of new pods. This strategy results in downtime and is generally not recommended.
3. **Canary Update Strategy**: Initially, a few new version pods (around 25% more) are created. If these operate smoothly, the older pods are then upgraded to the new version, and the additional canary pods are removed. This approach allows for a period of testing on a subset of real users. While not a direct feature of Kubernetes, it is a widely-used deployment methodology.
